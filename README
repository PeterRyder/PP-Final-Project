Parallel Programming Final Project

Peter Ryder, Brian Kovacik, Matt Holmes

We designed a parallel implementation of merge sort. The code can
be found in the code folder of this directory. Images of results
can be found in the images directory. The spreadsheet containing
our results can be found in the data.xlsx file. Finally, our final
report can be found in the report.pdf file.

Our code compiles on Linux, Windows, and the Blue Gene. Simply run
make within the code directory, and gcc and mpicc will compile
an executable. The program expects 1 argument which is the array
size.
